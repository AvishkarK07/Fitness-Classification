<h1>📋 Overview</h1>

This dataset contains 2,000 records representing individuals’ health and fitness metrics. It is designed for data analysis, health prediction modeling, and fitness insights generation.
Each record includes demographic details, lifestyle indicators, and key physiological measurements that can be used to predict or evaluate fitness levels.

<h1>🎯 Objectives</h1>

To explore and clean fitness-related data.

To visualize relationships between health parameters.

To build a classification model that predicts whether a person is Fit or Unfit.

To derive meaningful insights to improve personal health and wellness.
<h1>⚙️ Usage Ideas</h1>

You can use this dataset for:

Predictive modeling: Determine fitness status (is_fit) using regression/classification models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore how factors like sleep, nutrition, or smoking affect fitness.

Data visualization: Create charts for correlation, activity vs. nutrition, age vs. fitness, etc.

Health insights: Analyze patterns for wellness improvement strategies.
